## üõ† Development

### Frontend Development

To start the Angular frontend development server:

```bash
cd frontend
ng serve
```

Once running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will **auto-reload** whenever you modify any source files.

### Backend Development

To start the Node.js backend server:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:3002/`.

### Running with Docker

To run the complete application stack (database and backend):

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the PostgreSQL database and the backend API.

---

## üöÄ Building  

### Frontend Build

To build the frontend project:

```bash
cd frontend
ng build
```

This will compile the frontend and store the build artifacts in the `frontend/dist/` directory.

### Backend Build

To build the backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm run build
```

This will compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript in the `backend/dist/` directory.

---

## üß™ Running Tests  

### Unit Tests  
Execute unit tests using the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner:  
```bash
ng test
```

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests  
For E2E testing, run:  
```bash
ng e2e
```
Angular CLI does not include an E2E testing framework by default, so you can choose one that suits your project.
